Suggestions:

* reproduce StackOverflow's Markdown Preview editor (notice how they spice things up at time including Math Mode).  Today I just saw [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) which is gorgeous but potentially confusing.
* [Microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) ( not just a Twitter client, store the Tweets locally ) -- this is the hello world for Rails and as such FRP tools like React or Elm should devour this (don't also forget Reflex)
* Instagram
* the MTA turntile data set is obvious far for Data Science courses -- create a decent UI for such analysis, also [CitiBike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) 
* a zillion other things that should just be better in Elm
* Candy Crush Saga / Bejeweled / [2048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Qu1kgsGpM)
* Crossword Puzzles (such as [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/14/crosswords/crosswords-game-75-anniversary.html)).  Trivial to code, the challenge is a good User Interface design, separating the wheat from the chaff.
* Elm should be robust enough to emulate (or completely replace) your favorite jQuery or React UI -- try the [inspirograph](http://nathanfriend.io/inspirograph/)
* I always admired the website of **Rafael Albuquerque** [rafael.pt](http://rafael.pt/#index) and even used his designs on my own web page https://github.com/rafaqueque/rafael.pt this can be re-done in Elm (for a more functional)
