Suggestions:

* reproduce StackOverflow's Markdown Preview editor (notice how they spice things up at time including Math Mode).  Today I just saw [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) which is gorgeous but potentially confusing.
* [Microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) ( not just a Twitter client, store the Tweets locally ) -- this is the hello world for Rails and as such FRP tools like React or Elm should devour this (don't also forget Reflex)
* Instagram
* the MTA turntile data set is obvious far for Data Science courses -- create a decent UI for such analysis, also [CitiBike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) 
* a zillion other things that should just be better in Elm
