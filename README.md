# LearnElm
John's attempt at learning the functional programming language Elm.  See my questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=[elm]+user%3A737051).  Also [here](https://github.com/MonsieurCactus/github-mathjax-reader)

Instructions: **copy** + **paste** into left side of [elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) or on [share-elm.com](http://share-elm.com/sprout/55fdf4cee4b0966c193dbf03)

We are in the process of developing Elm-D3 interoperability please this one test case:

> Elm is a new language based on functional programming that compiles to JavaScript. The Elm compiler can significant errors in JavaScript code before we do. The type-safety features of Elm enable use to define reusable charts and interfaces, comparable to that of D3JS.  In fact, we can use it in conjunction with d3js.
