# LearnElm
John's attempt at learning the functional programming language Elm.  See my questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=[elm]+user%3A737051).  Also [here](https://github.com/MonsieurCactus/github-mathjax-reader)

Instructions: **copy** + **paste** into left side of [elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) or on [share-elm.com](http://share-elm.com/sprout/55fdf4cee4b0966c193dbf03)

We are in the process of developing Elm-D3 interoperability please this one test case:
  * http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/van-Gogh-ELM-01.html
  * http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/square.html (in progress)
  * try this one! http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/starry-night.html (NEEDS INSTRUCTIONS)
  * a primitive game involving random permutations http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/19by19.html
  * another game literally a race against [time](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/game-01.html).
  * ongoing discussion on [operators](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/operators.html) and [buttons](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/button.html) in Haskell Reflex-Dom (written in Elm, and experiment with **syntax highlighting**
  * my attempt at [domino](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/domino.html) game
  * a [world clock](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/timetable.html) (needs work)
  * a [fractal](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/mandelbrot-01.html) (exercise from Mandelbrot's [The Fratal Geometry of Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Geometry-Nature-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0716711869))

From a working **knight's tour** game with visualization of the past ([game](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/point-and-click.html))

Some of these apps are a bit theoretical.  Imagine trying to build a car and having hours-long discussions of the steering wheel.  Or the gear that connects the motor to the left front tire.  Back in Puerto Rico there is a auto-parts store called "House of Screws" and their motto is "Have a Screw Loose?" (literally "Â¿Le Falta un Tornillo?")
