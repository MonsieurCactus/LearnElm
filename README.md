# LearnElm
John's attempt at learning the functional programming language Elm.  See my questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=[elm]+user%3A737051).  Also [here](https://github.com/MonsieurCactus/github-mathjax-reader)

Instructions: **copy** + **paste** into left side of [elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) or on [share-elm.com](http://share-elm.com/sprout/55fdf4cee4b0966c193dbf03)

  * http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/square.html (in progress)
  * try this one! http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/starry-night.html (NEEDS INSTRUCTIONS)
  * a primitive game involving random permutations http://monsieurcactus.github.io/LearnElm/19by19.html
