# LearnElm
John's attempt at learning the functional programming language Elm

Instructions: **copy** + **paste** into left side of [elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) or on [share-elm.com](http://share-elm.com/sprout/55fdf4cee4b0966c193dbf03)

Obviously do not read `starry-night.js` since it can be compiled with `elm-make --output=starry-night.js starry-night.elm`
